Currently there aren't any sophisticated libraries to interact with Minecraft Anvil (more to come) files in Java (read, edit and write). 
And those that are around haven't been updated in a while or are directly integrated to projects like [mcaselector](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector). 

With this library I want to provide an up to date and efficient (and also overengineered) way to interact with Anvil (more to come) files.

jMCX will in the near future be part of [MinecraftOfflineOnlineConverter](https://github.com/paul-eff/MinecraftOfflineOnlineConverter) to enable UUID conversion down to entity level.

### Supports
- Operations: Currently only reading
- Compression types: LZIP, GZIP and NONE
### WIP
- Operations: Editing and writing
- Compression types: LZ4
### Future
- Bedrock Region format
- GUI (BIG maybe!)

# Usage

- Obviously download the jar
- Add it as a dependency to your project (dependent on your IDE)
- Take a look into the `Main.java` file.
